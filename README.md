# üåê Static Website Hosting on AWS S3 using Terraform

A fully automated infrastructure setup for hosting a static website on Amazon S3 using Terraform. This project demonstrates how to create an S3 bucket, upload files, configure public access, and enable static website hosting‚Äîall through Infrastructure as Code (IaC).

---

## üöÄ Project Objective

To automate the provisioning of AWS resources and host a static HTML/CSS website using Terraform.

---

## üß∞ Tech Stack

- Terraform
- AWS S3
- HTML/CSS
- Random provider
- AWS CLI (optional)

## üìù Terraform Code Overview

### üîß `provider.tf`

Configures AWS and required providers.

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source  = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "5.54.1"
    }
    random = {
      source  = "hashicorp/random"
      version = "3.6.2"
    }
  }
}

provider "aws" {
  region = "eu-north-1"
}
````

---

### üèóÔ∏è `main.tf`

Creates a unique-named S3 bucket and configures it for website hosting.

```hcl
resource "random_id" "rand_id" {
  byte_length = 8
}
...
resource "aws_s3_object" "index_html" {
  bucket       = aws_s3_bucket.mywebapp_bucket.bucket
  source       = "./index.html"
  key          = "index.html"
  content_type = "text/html"
}
```

---

### üì§ `output.tf`

Displays the final website URL after provisioning.

```hcl
output "website_url" {
  description = "S3 Static Website Endpoint"
  value       = aws_s3_bucket_website_configuration.mywebapp.website_endpoint
}
```

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Terraform Execution Workflow

Follow the commands below:

```bash
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

### Screenshot: Terraform Initialization

Initializes the working directory and downloads required providers.

### Screenshot: Terraform Plan

Shows execution plan before applying changes.

![Terraform Plan](screenshots/03-terraform-plan.png)

---

### Screenshot: Terraform Apply

Provisions the infrastructure and uploads files.

## üì∏ AWS Console Outputs

### ‚úÖ S3 Bucket Verification

S3 bucket successfully created via Terraform.

---

### üìÅ Uploaded Files

HTML and CSS files uploaded to the S3 bucket.

![S3 Uploaded Files](screenshots/06-s3-upload-files.png)

---

### üåç Static Website Settings

Shows website hosting settings with index and error pages configured.
